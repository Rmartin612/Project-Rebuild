**Hero Section Text:**
"Volunteer Eye Resources International – Bringing the Gift of Sight and Hope"

**Mission Statement (Prominent Section):**
"Volunteer Eye Resources International was founded to improve and restore sight to individuals living in extreme poverty in developing nations by providing high quality, comprehensive, & community-driven eye care services, applying best practices in global health, at no cost."

**Our Commitment (Text Block):**
"Most of us take for granted our ability to see the world around us and our ease with which we move through our daily lives without restriction. But for those in developing countries, without access to medical treatment and optometry services, poor vision can dramatically impact an individual's ability to learn, work, and support themselves and their family."

**Impact Stats (Use visual icons for these):**
"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), blindness is an underlying cause of poverty and hunger in developing countries. WHO estimates that of the world's 39 million blind people:
- 90% live in developing countries
- 80% of the cases are avoidable or treatable
- 48% are blind because of cataracts"

**Our Focus (Text Block):**
"We partner with communities in our host country to coordinate and provide adult and pediatric surgery, refractions, and eyeglasses. Our focus is not only on the provision of critically needed services but also to educate and train local providers for long-term sustainability. VER works with host communities to ensure all services are supported, coordinated, and provided in a culturally appropriate manner."

### **PAGE 2: ABOUT / INSPIRATION (about.html)**

**Our Inspiration (The Story of Bob Martin):**
"Volunteer Eye Resources International was founded by the friends, family, and larger international community of Robert Martin, a longtime advocate for vision services in South and Central America. 

As a teenager, Bob made his first trip to Ecuador with Amigos de las Americas, initiating his lifelong passion for helping others to achieve higher levels of health care, including the miracle of sight. For all who knew and worked with Bob, his enthusiasm, dedication, and sense of humor were contagious to those around him."
